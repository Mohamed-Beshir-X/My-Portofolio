# 🌿 Massary – Personal Story Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, designed not merely as a showcase of skills, but as a **story-driven academic and social narrative**.

The portfolio presents my journey as a student who grew under **financial and environmental limitations**, achieved real milestones, and transformed self-learning into a **community-oriented educational initiative** called **Massary**.

This project is structured intentionally for **academic committees, scholarship reviewers, and technical evaluators**.

## The Story Behind This Portfolio

My journey did not begin with privilege, advanced tools, or paid education.

I learned through **free educational resources**, discipline, and consistency.  
Despite limitations, I achieved academic, intellectual, and personal milestones that shaped a central belief:

> **Education gains its true value only when it is shared.**

This belief led to the creation of **Massary** — an ethical educational platform designed to help motivated students who lack guidance or opportunity.
